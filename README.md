lego-nxt-remote
===============

Lego NXT remote using Phonegap, Angular, and Typescript.

The primary purpose of this project is to help teach children how to program.  The javascript API allows easier access to robot programming without getting very low level.  The firmware of the Lego NXT brick does not need to be changed to use the API.

To create cordova wrappers $grunt create:cordova.  The command will create a build folder from which you can import into your favorite IDE.
